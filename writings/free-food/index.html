<h1>Why Free Food Tastes Better</h1>

People often declare that free food tastes better. I did not believe them. 
It was not until college that I realized the truth behind this theorem. But I 
was confused. Why does free food tastes better?
</p>

<p>
I understood that if a person spends a lot of energy, time, or money to a 
cause (or product), that person would convince himself that that cause (or 
product) was good, even though it might not be. This is known as cognitive 
dissonance. From this, I theorized that because the cost of free food is zero, 
at least in terms of money, there would be no reason for a person to convince 
himself that the food is good. Hence, bad food would be seen as bad food, 
mediocre food as mediocre, and good food as good.

But I find that I enjoy a free pizza from a pizza chain better than a 
gourmet pizza from a classy pizzeria. [1] The gourmet pizza used better in- 
gredients and was often-roasted, but it was $20. The free pizza was, well, 
ordinary. The answer to this puzzling question is found in Expectation 
Theory. [2]
</p>

<p>
When you eat a free slice of pizza, you have no expectations. You did 
not sacriﬁce much, so therefore you do not expect much in return. But of 
course, pizza, being pizza, is extremely good. The return value you get for 
what you paid is very high. Because of this unexpected high return value, 
you enjoy that return much more. In the world of human-eat-human, you 
stand victorious. You defeated the system.

This applies to other things. My professor in one of my computer science
courses decided to write a book for the class and distribute it out for free. I
bought a hard copy at-cost [3] for $12. It is the most exciting computer science
book I have ever read. I do not wish to diminish the author’s accomplishment
because it is a very well-written book. In fact, one of the conditions in
enjoying free (or cheap) items is that the item has to be enjoyable in the
first place. It’s not like I will enjoy a free but burnt slice of pizza or a
cheap but useless textbook.  This theorem of mine is not scientific by any
means, but when it comes to items such as foods, one is often called to simply
stick to one’s guts.

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
  [1] When I say enjoy, I mean not how tasty it is. Rather, I mean how much joy I
  get out of it.
  </p>

  <p>
  [2] I made this study up, though I’m sure there is something like this in
  economics.
  </p>

  <p>
  [3] That is, the cost for printing.
