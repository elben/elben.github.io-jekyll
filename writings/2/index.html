      <p>A story. A fairytale. The whole experience, a delight to the senses.
      That’s what Dave was building. The idea came to him in fourth period
      English yesterday. Mr. Kosh had read them a nice story about a man and his
      little garden below a hill, and how he slowly built his garden, adding
      vineyards and trees and carved lakes and rivers, and how after twenty
      years the man looked up and found himself forever lost in his own
      forest.</p>
      <p>After that story, Dave wanted to make something beautiful. It was for
      Katie, a girl. They shared two classes, math in the morning and English in
      the afternoon. When Mr. Kosh finished the story Dave had looked over at
      Katie and he saw her so alive and beautiful that it hurt him.</p>
      <p>After school that day Dave did not talk on the bus the whole way back.
      He stared out the window and did not notice when his best friend Brandon
      got up to sit next to someone else. Dave was thinking, iterating,
      building. This was his largest project yet, and it would be his best.</p>
      <p>He started the project that weekend. He walked around the house and
      collected little pieces of paper, cloth and ribbons. His mother took him
      to local art store, and there he slowly walked the isles, gliding his
      young fingers along the textured papers and the smooth glass trinkets. He
      took in how the papers felt and how light bounced and traveled through the
      glass. He took it all in, these little hints of beauty. And he thought of
      Katie, how nice it would be to touch her cheeks and to get lost in her
      eyes. He walked out of the store without buying anything for he had no
      money to spend, but that did not matter to him. He didn’t even know what
      he wanted to build yet. He knew only the passion that drove him, and that
      was enough.</p>
      <p>Next Saturday his best friend Brandon asked if he wanted to ride bikes.
      “I can’t,” Dave replied, “my mom said I can’t.” It was a lie, but did he
      have a choice?</p>
      <p>“Then let’s play on your computer,” Brandon said.</p>
      <p>“I can’t have friends over.”</p>
      <p>Brandon looked at him, and saw. “You’re hiding something.”</p>
      <p>“What?”</p>
      <p>“You’re hiding something. I know it.”</p>
      <p>“Well it’s not my fault if—.” Dave almost blurted it out, that he
      doesn’t care about anything but building this something for Katie, that
      all other wonderments and enjoyments meant nothing to him, and will never
      mean anything again.</p>
      <p>“Fine, don’t tell me,” Brandon shot as he got on his bike to leave.</p>
      <p>Dave watched Brandon pedal back home, along quiet street they shared.
      He looked up and noticed the steady dance of autumn leaves. A feeling came
      over Dave, and it surprised him. He felt as if nothing would ever be the
      same, that he would never find a way out of this forest he was
      building.</p>
