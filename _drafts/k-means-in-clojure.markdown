K-means is one of those algorithms that have hundreds of tutorials floating
around on the internet. But I implemented k-means as a way to learn Clojure.
This article is part walkthrough of the code and part a reflection on what I've
learned. I hope it provides some insight from a beginner's point-of-view.

## K-means

Say that a clothing brand may want to know how they should cut
their shirts for sizes Small, Medium and Large. They can measure a bunch of
people's waists and chests and get a graph that looks something like this:

![K-means 1](http://cl.ly/image/2R3D3u0N3w45/k-means.001.png)

Humens excel at recognizing patternsâ€”you probably picked out three clusters
right away. But how do we get a computer to do this? This is where clustering
algorithms like k-means comes in.

**Initialization step**. In the first step of k-means, we pick three random
**centers** (three because of Small, Medium and Large) that are in the bounds of
our sample.  Something like this:

![K-means 2](http://cl.ly/image/1U2R0v0K3O3b/k-means.002.png)

**Step 1**. For each sample point, we find the closest center and associate that sample with
that center.

![K-means 3](http://cl.ly/image/392J3K333H17/k-means.003.png)

**Step 2**. Then, for each cluster, we find the *mean* point.  For example, if a
cluster had the points `(0, 0)` and `(5, 5)`, the mean would be the point `(2.5,
2.5)`. We then move the centers to that mean point. Notice, for example, how the
red center moved to the mean of the red cluster:

![K-means 4](http://cl.ly/image/2J2b0v0f2A1p/k-means.004.png)

**Repeat Step 1**. We then go through each sample again, and choose the *new*
closest center.  Notice how some some yellow samples switched from the yellow
cluster to the green cluster.

![K-means 5](http://cl.ly/image/3m3i2f0q2F1O/k-means.005.png)

**Repeat Step 2**. These steps are repeated until the centers converge (the means no longer move)
or until some pre-defined maximum number of steps. Below, we see that the
centers have convereged. We now have a cluster we can use to figure out how to
cut our Small, Medium and Large sizes to accomodate the people in the cluster.

## Code

The k-means algorithm can easily be written without needing state modifications.
Clojure's data structures makes this easy, even almost *mandatory*. So we can
write the core algorithm in a stateless fashion. But because k-means is an
interative approach, this implies that someone else will have to keep state. In
this case, I've deffered the state changes to the UI that I wrote on top.

The code is [here](https://github.com/elben/k-means/). To run the demo:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/elben/k-means.git
cd k-means
lein run
{% endhighlight %}

Left-click to spray points, right-click to add centers, `[Space]` to take a
step. Press `r` to reset the demo.

At the highest level, the core k-means library exposes only one function: `(defn
update-centers [points centers] ...)`, which returns an array of clusters.

For example:

{% highlight clojure %}
;; Our points are (0, 0), (5, 5) and (100, 100).
;; Our centers are (1, 1) and (90, 90).
=> (update-centers [[0 0] [5 5] [100 100]] [[1 1] [90 90]])
[[2.5 2.5] [100 100]]
{% endhighlight %}

The function looks like this (I've simplified it by removing error-checking
code):

{% highlight clojure linenos %}
(defn update-centers
  "The fundamental k-means step.
  Return updated centers, given points and centers."
  [points centers]
  (let [center-clusters (points-to-centers points centers)
        updated-centers (vec (map center-of-points center-clusters))]
    updated-centeres))
{% endhighlight %}

Line 5 does what we described in **Step 1** above. It takes every point and
associates that point with the closest center. The function returns a vector of
points for each center. Here is a test for `points-to-centers`:

{% highlight clojure %}
;; Points 10,10 and 20,20 go to center 0, and point 100,100 goes to center 1.
(= [[[10 10] [20 20]] [[100 100]]]
   (points-to-centers [[10 10] [20 20] [100 100]]
                      [[0 0] [100 100]]))))
{% endhighlight %}

Line 6 is **Step 2** of k-means. Now that we have the cluster of points, we need
to find the mean of each cluster. This is done by executing `center-of-point` on
each cluster of points, hence the `map`.

Here is a test for `center-of-points`:

{% highlight clojure %}
(= [2.5 2.5 2.5] (center-of-points [[0 0 0] [5 5 5]]))
{% endhighlight %}

I won't go into detail of the [rest of the code](https://github.com/elben/k-means/blob/master/src/k_means/core.clj)
here, mostly because I don't think what's important here is the code.

## Takeaways

I started this project because I wanted learn Clojure. I had been writing
Clojure snippets here and there, through [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com/).
But it's hard to get a feel for the benefits of Clojure's ideals without
implementing something of a larger scale. This k-means project, however,
taught me a lot of things about Clojure and functional programming.

**You can do a lot with little**. When I started this project, I knew `defn`,
`vec`, `map` and `reduce`. That was about it. This project uses no fancy methods
or features. But even with a small toolset, I was able to 

**Persistent data structures simplify reasoning**. You know what your functions
ought to do. There is no fear of unknown side-effects. Consider this snippet:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defn center-of-points [points]
  "Return the mean center of the given points"
  ...)

(def points [1 2 3])
(center-of-points points)
{% endhighlight %}

I don't have to worry about what may happen to `points`. Can I use `points`
again? Should I have cloned it before passing it into `center-of-points`? These
questions simply go away.

**Persistent data structures encourages modularity**. When your functions
*cannot* mutate your data structures, it forces your hand towards modular
design, whether you intended to or not. I found myself using `let` to do this.
For example:

{% highlight clojure %}
(let [a (f1 args)
      b (map f2 a)]
  (f3 b))
{% endhighlight %}

**Persistent data structures simplify testing**. Similar to the modularity
comment, I found that testing became much more obvious. As your functions get
smaller and more modular, your tests follow. Data in, data out. No need for
cumbersome setup and state change verifications.
