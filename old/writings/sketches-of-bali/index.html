      <h1>Sketches of Bali</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Elizabeth was tired of the tourists and had found a family of eight
        who had chartered a van from Denpasar to Bukti. She had given each child
        a piece of chocolate and the father 5,000 rupiah. So she went with them
        to Bukti, wherever that was. She sat in the back with the children and
        played with them in broken Indonesian. They had just passed a small
        township when the driver stopped to pee, so Elizabeth and the children
        popped the back hatch and wriggled out and ran around and bought young
        coconuts from an old man pulling a wagon piled twice his height. He used
        a large, rusty cleaver to split the top off the coconuts and pulled out
        straws from his thrice-stitched pockets and offered them to Elizabeth.
        She looked at his ancient hands, took the straws and smiled. Saya suka
        kepala disini—I like the head here—she said. They all laughed, and the
        children ran around singing kepala kelapa, kepala kelapa, Eli adalah
        kepala kelapa!—Coconut head, coconut head, Eli is a coconut head! When
        the driver walked out of the woods (zipping up his pants), Elizabeth and
        the children said goodbye to the old man and his wagon and piled back
        into the van.</p>

        <p>The adults up front started talking about Suharto and Elizabeth
        strained to hear and wanted to chime in because she had studied
        international politics and had some ideas of her own. But they were
        talking too fast and she couldn’t keep up, so she rolled down her
        windows and let the breeze sneak into the van, whistling that ancient
        Eastern song which slowly lulled the children to sleep. Elizabeth stared
        out the window and liked how the van rolled steadily down the moistened
        dirt road, wiping out the layered history of previous motorcars.
        Motorcar after motorcar, layer after layer—all trampling the trampled.
        Elizabeth liked that thought, so she kept it.</p>

        <p>Beyond the road tin shacks glittered under cool sunlight. A weary red
        shack caught Elizabeth’s eye, and she noticed a bucket painted blue
        placed below its slanted roof capturing the slow drip, drip, drip of the
        morning rain. Clothing lines shot from the red shack and tied themselves
        to neighboring shacks, and she followed the lines from shack to shack as
        the hanging clothes waved hello and goodbye in the wind. The van tumbled
        on, and at the last possible moment before the sight disappeared she
        realized that the lines formed a web, a network—a village.</p>

        <p>Suddenly Elizabeth felt her body jerk forward and she was flying and
        her face slammed into the seats in front of her. The children woke up
        and the adults got out of the van. She looked up to a donkey staring at
        her. He was a gray working donkey with a patch around its left eye. A
        satchel hung from each side of the donkey, and a small boy and his
        mother were trying to get the donkey off the road. The mother was urging
        the donkey with a stick and yelled something to the boy. The boy ran off
        and came back with a bushel of bananas and a large banana leaf. He waved
        the bananas in front of the donkey and when that didn’t work he tried to
        tickle the donkey with the banana leaf, yelling bergerak, bodoh! The boy
        eventually gave up, grabbed a stick and followed his mother’s lead. The
        adults and children emptied the van and they all had sticks and bananas
        but the donkey would not budge. Elizabeth laughed and closed her eyes
        and took a deep breath and searched for the smell of the dirt road and
        bananas and donkey. Bergerak, bodoh. Bergerak! She opened her eyes and
        up ahead the road dipped and disappeared. Instead she saw kites made out
        of newspapers with colorful tails carefully cut out from plastic market
        bags. The kites danced in the wind, laughing.</p>
